# gpaExample

The example data package for GPA (https://github.com/dongjunchung/GPA), a statistical approach to prioritizing GWAS results by integrating pleiotropy information and annotation data. 'GPA' package provides computationally efficient and user friendly interface to fit GPA models and implement the hypothesis testing for the pleiotropy and the enrichment of annotation for the associated SNPs.

The example data consist of p-values of 1,219,805 SNPs for five psychiatric disorder GWAS from the psychiatric GWAS consortium (PGC), with the annotation data using genes preferentially expressed in the central nervous system (CNS).
